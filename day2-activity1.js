//Create a variable called age. Write an if statement that logs "Yes i can serve you" if the age is greater than 17 and else logs "You aren't old enough"
//Take your if statement and add a variable called country in 

let age = 18;
let country = "UK"; 

if (age > 17 && country == "UK") {
    console.log("Yes I can serve you")
} else{
    console.log("You aren't old enough")
}

// Another way to write this if statement for a single condition is 

let age2 = 18;

(age2 > 17) ? console.log("Yes i can serve you") : console.log("You aren't old enough");
